Script to Automated Installation of DNSCrypt
--------------------------------------------

This is a simple bash script which installs and configures
[DNSCrypt](https://www.dnscrypt.org/).

To use it, simply ``cd`` to ``installer`` directory, and run
``dnscrypt-installer``.

I tested it on ``Gnu/Linux Debian``. It also should work for
``Gnu/Linux Ubuntu`` too.
